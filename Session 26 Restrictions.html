    <p>Since Covid was found, life has never been normal. We haven't been able to see loved ones, go to places, or got to school. We have had to social distance, take Covid tests, wear masks and stay at home unless we have to go somwhere urgently. But, as more people get vaccinated, restrictions ease and life is slowly getting back to normal. Theme parks are opening back up, sport is back on and we can go on holiday. It is obvious that brighter times are ahead.</p>
